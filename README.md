# _Java_
primer project

I am a rookie, but I never give up.

Someday I will understand everything. 

Maybe there will be a day, maybe not, but I know I'm getting closer and closer to it.

The world of programming is melodic, it makes me forget about troubles

It allows me to make and thinck like artists
